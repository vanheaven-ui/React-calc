## Background <a name = "about"></a>

This project was a task by [Microverse Inc.](https://www.microverse.org/) to build a browser calculator for the Math Magicians fictitious company. The milestones listed below constituted the project development in order of execution:
1. Project setup - This involved using `create-react-app` to initialize the application and setting up the necessary dependencies.
2. Build the calculator user interface - This involved implementing the project React components.
3. User interface update - This is when the User Interface was modified with CSS style rules and flexbox rules.
4. Calculator functionality - Javascript functions were implemented to manage the calculator arithmetic logic.
5. Harmonize the calculator logic and the calculator components - The calculator functionality was implemented by using event listeners to make the calculator components respond to the calculator logic.
